Dear Dipo Ashafa,



On behalf of the Odugbesan and Osaghae families, we extend our deepest and most heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of you for the overwhelming support, love, and sympathy expressed following the passing of our beloved matriarch, Mrs. Elizabeth Esohe Odugbesan.



Your presence, whether physical, virtual, or spiritual, brought us great comfort and strength during this challenging time. Your shared memories and kind words about Mum have helped us remember the joy and love she brought to us all, overshadowing the pain of her loss.



We are incredibly moved by your generous donations, thoughtful flowers, cards, messages and prayers. They have been a beacon of light in this dark time, and we want you to know that your kindness has made a significant impact on our families.



The myriad ways you’ve reached out to us, standing by our side, have been the embodiment of love and community, and for this, we are eternally grateful. We can feel Mum’s warmth and her loving spirit in each gesture, call, and message received.



We wish to express special thanks to those who travelled from far and near to pay their respects, and to those who have been continuously supportive, offering their time, resources, and condolences. Your presence was a comforting reminder of the extensive network of lives touched by Mum’s kindness, grace, and love.



While words seem inadequate to express our gratitude for your outpouring of love and support, please know that every gesture has been deeply appreciated. Your collective embrace has helped cushion the pain and provided solace to our grieving hearts.



It is our hope that the love and kindness you have shown will be returned to you manifold, and that the bonds forged or strengthened during this time will endure. May the soul of our dear Mum, Mrs. Elizabeth Esohe Odugbesan, rest in peace, and may the memories we shared continue to be a source of comfort and inspiration to us all.



Thank you once again for your love, support, and understanding. We are forever grateful.



With profound gratitude,





Adewale, Adedotun and Olufunso Odugbesan.
