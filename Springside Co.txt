Your kindness has been a beacon of light, helping to illuminate our way through these difficult days.



Your heartfelt contribution has allowed us to commemorate our mother’s wonderful life and vibrant spirit in a manner she truly deserved. The love and unity she epitomized were evident in the support we received from dear friends like you.



Our hearts are warmed by your generosity, through your kind words, your presence and your generous donation of ₦100000. Every gesture has been a comforting embrace, reminding us of the love and respect many held for our dear Mum.



During such times, kindness like yours is a beacon of hope, a reminder of the beauty of shared bonds and the resilience of the human spirit. It’s been a pillar for us, a symbol of the goodness in the world, even in moments of sorrow.



Consider this letter a small token of our immense appreciation for your empathy and support. We vow to uphold and live by the virtues Mum instilled in us, honoring your kindness by spreading the same love and compassion she ingrained in our hearts.



We wish to extend our sincerest thanks, once more, for being our support, for your condolences, and for sharing in our memories of a truly extraordinary woman. May your days be filled with love, peace, and joy, just as you have brought to our lives during these trying times.
